# The Role of Quantum Tunneling in Metal-Ligand Proton Tautomerism

Description:

This repository contains Python scripts used for kinetic modeling and analysis in our study "The Role of Quantum Tunneling in Metal-Ligand Proton Tautomerism". The paper presents the first experimental evidence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in metal-ligand proton tautomerism (MLPT) in a ruthenium complex supported by a pyridine-based PN ligand.

The scripts in this repository support:

Analysis of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs)

Fitting of temperature-dependent rate data

Visualization of Arrhenius and Eyring plots

These tools were used to dissect the mechanistic pathway of MLPT and to demonstrate that quantum tunneling plays a central role in the tautomerization process. Our findings show that tautomeric forms exhibit distinct reactivity and that QMT may be a general feature in pincer-type systems.
